<p>Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook will take the stage in Cupertino, California on Tuesday to unveil the latest iPhones. This is the company’s most important day of the year. The smartphone makes up almost half of Apple’s sales and new models juice other sources of revenue.</p>
<p>There will be three new models: “Pro” upgrades to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max and a replacement for the iPhone XR. The company is also readying new Apple Watches.</p>
